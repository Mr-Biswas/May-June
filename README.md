# May-June
Welcome to My Project Repository â€” May-June Edition

This GitHub repository showcases a curated collection of industry-level personal projects that I successfully completed during Mayâ€“June. Each project reflects my ability to solve real-world business problems, apply technical skills across tools like SQL, Python, Power BI, and Excel, and adapt quickly in a fast-paced learning environment.

ðŸ§  Whether it's designing an ETL pipeline, building interactive dashboards, performing deep-dive analysis, or generating actionable insightsâ€”every project here is a step toward impactful data-driven decision-making.

ðŸ”– Naming Convention:

P1, P2, etc. â†’ Personal Projects

I â†’ Internship Projects

Explore these works to see my journey as an aspiring Data Analyst, where I combine problem-solving, storytelling, and technology to create real value.
